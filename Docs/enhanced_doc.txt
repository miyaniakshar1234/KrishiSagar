## 🧠 Advanced Features & Intelligence

### 🌱 1. **Farmer’s Daily Crop Analysis System**

#### 🔍 Workflow:
- Each farmer begins their crop cycle by setting the crop start and expected harvest date
- Daily uploads of crop images (multiple angles encouraged)
- Each upload is timestamped and hashed using blockchain
- AI engine processes the images, identifying deviations from healthy baselines

#### 🔬 Analysis Dimensions:
- Disease symptoms (rust, blight, fungus, viral)
- Pest damage (leaf miner, aphids, etc.)
- Nutrient deficiencies (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium indicators)
- Growth curve comparison: expected vs actual size, color, leaf development
- Cross-reference with:
  - Weather (humidity, temperature, rainfall forecasts)
  - Water pH and contamination indicators
  - Soil test reports (macro/micro nutrients, organic matter, salinity)

#### ⚠️ Decision Engine & Alerts:
- Detects early warning signs and notifies farmer with suggested action
- Recommends treatment packs (organic or chemical)
- Matches prescriptions with live inventory from nearby agro stores
- If unavailable, expands geo-radius to other stores
- Only recommends products that meet **required chemical composition**

#### 🌐 Regional Disease Outbreak Detection:
- Uses pattern matching across multiple farmer reports
- Identifies similar symptoms within villages, talukas, districts
- Raises collective alert if outbreak threshold is met
- Shares verified prevention protocol and mass advisory

#### 📊 Growth Deviation Prediction:
- If health doesn't improve in expected number of days:
  - Uses AI trendlines to detect underperformance
  - Suggests reason hypotheses (soil, disease, irrigation)
  - Allows expert to annotate and respond

#### 👨‍⚕️ Expert Consultation:
- Farmers can manually request expert advice
- Experts can proactively comment on anomaly clusters
- Conversation stored, timestamped, and visible in farmer dashboard
